TODO 	hierarchy/owning
	use memcpy instead of Initialize
	replace current scenegraph stuff
	Do all events of components of same type simultaneous (write method to divide array of indices in chunks and call the chuncks sequentially on each their own async thread)
	Components can change TypeIndex (Bad for serializing,Possible alternative: Compile time string hashes + check for collision in debug)
	Start at 1 with scenegraph indices (check if works correctly)
	assert when calling destroy on Transform (use destroy on gameobject)
	

Priorities:
P0:
TodoList
P1:
[RequireComponent]
Culling
identify independent computations at the highest possible level => candidates for threading, 
static vs dynamic in components
P2:
Base layer for an Event based system
P3:
Editor like interface
Animation System
