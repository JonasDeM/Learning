TODO 	replace uint32_t/uint16_t with a using
	access modifiers + friend
	assert messages
	add static asserts in add/get component and other places
	write down (instead of do) every micro optimization that might be possible (e.g. There's an initialize method instead of constructor with initializer list) 
	Comment thoroughly, format nicely
	Do all events of components of same type simultaneous (write method to divide array of indices in chunks and call the chuncks sequentially on each their own async thread)
	assert when calling destroy on Transform (use destroy on gameobject)
	Components can change TypeIndex (Bad for serializing)
	maybe start at 1 with scenegraph indices
