TODO 	hierarchy/owning + Worldmatrix
	global include met #include "glm/glm.hpp" en wa andere glms stuf + using namespace glm
	replace current scenegraph stuff
	Do all events of components of same type simultaneous (write method to divide array of indices in chunks and call the chuncks sequentially on each their own async thread)
	Components can change TypeIndex (Bad for serializing,Possible alternative: Compile time string hashes + check for collision in debug)
	Start at 1 with scenegraph indices (check if works correctly)
	assert when calling destroy on Transform (use destroy on gameobject)
